## Capitalism, anarchism, UBI, ...

The ideas floating around in here are looking at the historical, anthropological, etc., viewpoints of our society, how it got here, what principles etcs. 

As a rough starting point, my current ideas from all this include the following. 

There are three pillars of our intearactions: 

1. What are we allowed to do? (Laws, government, state)  Safety is a big deal here.
2. How can we do what we want? (Market, capitalism, economics)  Contributing is here.
3. Why are doing what we are doing (Family, friends, community (communism) ).  Belong is here and all sorts of other good stuff

My basic premise is that the first two are tools for supporting the third. We tend to forget that at times. It is up to each of us to care about three in our own ways and it is imperative to not allow the first two to interfere with that, as they so often do. 

For the first two, there are specific narratives that help promote raising the universe. In particular, minimizing the laws of the state to prevent physical violence is a key concern. Governments tend to get big on having lots of laws which can then be arbitrarily enforced giving a blank check for whatever they want to accomplish. It is good to tamper that down. The criminal justice system should be pared down to only using force when force is necessary.

Economically, the government often does provide various services. It will always be a negotiation about how that should work. There is nothing particularly clear here, except perhaps trying to come up with a notion of self-governance within the units while holding the people to meeting the needs of the community. This should be largely limited to infrastructure needs, etc., that are not amenable to small-time actors. 

The mechanisms of capitalism in a free market are at odds with that of the free market. But it seems from the history that allowing for capital accumulations, in some fashion, helps promote technological growth. Those accumulations, however, seem to damp down the free market and often twist government. 

The solution is to implement a redistribution plan. It is like a UBI, but specifically designed to spread the capital accumulations. It does not work too quickly, enabling a nice buildup. 

My proposal would be to tax wealth at 4% per year, computed daily, paid monthly, with the expected distribution being applied to any required payments. That 4% would be broken down into 4 categories for disbursement: district, state, country, world, with a quarter going to each. This allows for a gradual equalization of wealth everywhere, but taking into account some of the current higher costs. 

The justification, in addition to the assumed benefits, would be that everyone is standing on the shoulders of everyone else, so to speak. Thus, their success should pay out dividends. That is, this is a universal dividend program. The benefits would be far more money being circulated and, if one is above average in wealth, then one should be asked to give back, requiring using the wealth in some effective way. 

Now one interesting implication of this is that if one loans out money, then instead of 4% of that money being taken away, it gets preserved. This is particularly true if the one borrowing has a wealth below average. That is to say, there is effectively an interest rate of 4% that is given for loaning out the money even interest free. (a bit dodgy to say this as those below average wealth would still have their pay out to them be reduced by that).
