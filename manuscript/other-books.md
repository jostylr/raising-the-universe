## A New Buddhist Path by David Loy

This is a book talking about the differences between traditional Buddhism and western Buddhism and how to have a Buddhism version that is informed by science and serves the needs of the current era. 

He argues against the duality of our many ideas and views. Traditional Buddhism suggests that there is a transcendence one can achieve, awakening, ceasing the rebirthing, etc. Western Buddhism is more of a psychological trick, calming one's self in the face of many external difficulties. 

Loy's view seems to be that the real nugget of truth in Buddhism is that we are all part of one thing, the whole universe. That the notion of self is illusory. There is no self to calm, there is no self to be reborn and no self to be enlightened, except the universal self itself. It answers the question of "If there is no self, who is enlightened?" and the answer is the universe itself. 

He particularly wishes to avoid noun-verb; he likes just verb. That is, all is process. He views evolution in that way, as a process of the universe finding itself, exploring itself. It is creative, "The dance is not supervised by a dancing master who programs the dancers' movements, but neither are the steps arbitrary. Rather, the dance evolves as the dancers discover new possibilities, in a ballet whose choreography never ceases to transform and (usually) complexify. In other words, the cosmos *self-orgranizes*. 

Nonattachment is a key concept in Buddhism. But this is different than not caring. If one views Buddhism as about enlightening ones own self or dealing with the tribulations of one's day, that is inherently a selfish act in the sense of small-time selfishness. Your concern for others may be present, but it certainly is not being derived from those attitudes. Indeed, he asserts that the notion of karma and rebirth were used as a way to keep oppression in societies (those who are low, deserve it). And that is rather problematical. 

But if the little self is not real and one gets to a point of being in that zone of opening up to the universal mind, seeing all of us as one, then that drives the caring. Nonattachment is nonattachment to the little self's *dukkha*, that is, the suffering of the little self being driven by greed, aggresion, and delusion. If we acknowledge the little self is not permanent, not real, then we can also let go of the suffering. Meditation can help us get out of the mental habits that define the little self. 

He raises the issues of economic and ecological challenges. For economics, the question is how to have the system itself embrace the universal nature. It is made up of human beings, but they are all individually powerless to affect even though collectively it could change instantly. The idea is to evolve it into something else, something that supports the creativity of the universe. It is not a matter of wealthy vs poor or about evil corporate overlords. There is no question of good vs evil, but rather an understanding of the suffering and the path to get past that suffering. He raises the point that the most horrific evils have been done by those believing they were doing the right thing for their people. 

The ecological crisis he asserts is a spiritual crisis. As technology has grown, so has our separation from the natural world and each other. It is the same technology which endangers the world. It is almost as if it is a self-correcting system in that the more we are led away from our natural role as creative supporters of the universe and into a role of self-serving destroyers, the world responds with threats to our very survival. It is a creative response, one that allows for us to respond in positive ways or to continue the decline. Our dancing partner wants to dance with us, but does not like the dance we have beend doing. 

Notice how the above is framed in dualistic terms. It is hard not to. In the end, there is but one dancer, but it takes many forms of the dance. 

Structural dukkha is a core issue to tackle. Greed is exemplified by the capitalist system (corporate, consumerism, stocks), aggression is the state, media is the delusion. It is a system built on our dukkha, magnified and out of control. 

He asserts that we have a sense of lack that comes from our little self, feeling insecure for it has no grounding. The only way is to let go, to let the bottom of the bucket fall open. How does a sense of lack relate to the structural? 

The book is full of other information as well. It is quite dense but also very good. The main call of the book is to begin a notion of being using Buddhism that focuses on the here and now, but not materially as the West does. Use the idea of losing the self to inform compassionate, just actions that help our universe thrive with us in it. 

It is hard to say it is a call to arms. It is rather a call to peace, of acceptance of the needs and good nature of us all, of the one, of the empty that is all. 

He recommends a variety of books. Two stand out to me:  Brian Swimme, Thomas Berry. *The Universe Story*.  Loyal Rue. *Everybody's Story*.
