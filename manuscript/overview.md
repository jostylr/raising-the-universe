-# Overview

Let's raise the universe. The universe is vast. We are small in comparison, but we have a power that the universe lacks: consciousness. The universe is an amazing place, but it lacks the ability to reflect, to revel in itself, to know that it is amazing. 

That is where you and I come in. We can do these things. We are the eyes of the universe watching itself. Our consciousness gives rise to a consciousness in the universe. 

It is not yet clear whether this is a good thing. Our emotions are strong and can be quite painful. Humans have experienced horrible things, often at the hands of other humans or even at their own hands.

We will start by discussing the scientific basis of this religion. While science does not dictate the interpretation that this religion takes, it is compatible with it. 

At the core of what this religion is really about, it is the interplay between individual and collective. As we will see, being aware of and embracing our differences and oneness is at the core of the mystery that we seek to investigate. 

Once we have discussed the conceptual underpinnings, we will then delve into our emotions. Each emotion needs to be witnessed and honored as it comes about, but many of them need to be handled with care and focus.

How we relate to one another and to all that we come into contact is of fundamental concern to our day-to-day activities. There is very little that we do, outside of simply thinking, that is not about relating with someone else. And even thinking is about relating to ourselves. The relationships are the key. We can start with the ones we love and move on to include, at furthering distances, into our circle of acceptance. 

Situations arise that are beyond our direct control. How to handle these siutations is what makes each of us unique. These are the lessons that the universe learns and it leans on us to learn them. While there will not be prescriptions on how to act, we will look into various things to consider. 

Community is the natural outgrowth of relationships. It is our way of journeying into the oneness of who and what we are. There are a variety of community considerations and a variety of communities to consider.

A special kind of community is the very kind that we are attempting to build: religious communities. We shall take a look at various religions and how this religion relates to them. We start with detailing the suggested rituals of this religion. 

We end with a look at our fundamental purpose from the perspective of this religion. It is tied deeply into our feelings. We endeavor to be joyful and ignite the joy and wonder in others. 

Join with me and be a Raiser, cutting through the fog of our small lives to see the vast majesty of who and what we really are. It will require courage and humility, much failure, and an overwhelming amount of faith in the unknowable.
