## God

Does God exist? This question is old and unanswerable, but the unanswerability is largely due to not knowing what God ought to be. 

God is often described as some omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent being. Somehow it is something that created the universe. It therefore exists outside the universe and its view of the universe is rather unclear. It is also unclear why it would reveal itself to some, but not all or even most. It is futher unclear to me that if a being existed that created the universe and could control it in some fashion, why it would want us to worship it and why it does not bear a responsibility to the vast suffering that occurs in the world. 

All of those doubts are predicated in God being a thing with some kind of mental state akin to ours, with emotions, desires, even explicit thoughtful knowledge. 

But what if God was more of an infant? And what if it was not outside the universe, but was a crucial part of it? Indeed, what if one could even think of God as the universe in some sense? 

Is there something in the universe that we know of that could play that role? If so, how would it inform our actions and desires in life? If there was such a something that was part of physics, would the question "Does God exist?" even have a meaning? Could faith not be a question of believing in existence, but rather a question of accepting an interpretation of what is (currently) known to be real?

This is the line of questioning we will pursue. The idea is that together, we are all raising God or, in a less charged fashion, raising the Universe. 

We are the Raisers.

## Raising the Universe

Let's raise the universe. The universe is vast. We are small in comparison, but we have a power that the universe lacks: consciousness. The universe is an amazing place, but it lacks the ability to reflect, to revel in itself, to know that it is amazing. 

That is where you and I come in. We can do these things. We are the eyes of the universe watching itself. Our consciousness gives rise to a consciousness in the universe. 

It is not yet clear whether this is a good thing. Our emotions are strong and can be quite painful. Humans have experienced horrible things, often at the hands of other humans or even at their own hands.

We will start by discussing the scientific basis of this religion. While science does not dictate the interpretation that this religion takes, it is compatible with it. 

At the core of what this religion is really about is the interplay between the individual and the collective. As we will see, being aware of and embracing our differences and oneness is at the core of the mystery that we seek to investigate. 

Once we have discussed the conceptual underpinnings, we will then delve into our emotions. Each emotion needs to be witnessed and honored as it comes about, but many of them need to be handled with care and focus.

How we relate to one another and to all that we come into contact is of fundamental concern to our day-to-day activities. There is very little that we do, outside of simply thinking, that is not about relating with someone else. And even thinking is about relating to ourselves. The relationships are the key. We can start with the ones we love and move on to include, at furthering distances, our various levels of acceptance. 

Situations arise that are beyond our direct control. How to handle these siutations is what makes each of us unique. These are the lessons that the universe learns and it leans on us to learn them. While there will not be prescriptions on how to act, we will look into various things to consider. 

Community is the natural outgrowth of relationships. It is our way of journeying into the oneness of who and what we are. There are a variety of community considerations and a variety of communities to consider.

A special kind of community is the very kind that we are attempting to build: religious communities. We shall take a look at various religions and how this religion relates to them. We start that section with detailing the suggested rituals of this religion. 

We end with a look at our fundamental purpose from the perspective of this religion. It is tied deeply into our feelings. Our conclusion is that we should endeavor to be joyful and ignite the joy and wonder in others. 

Join with me and be a Raiser, cutting through the fog of our small lives to see the vast majesty of who and what we really are. It will require courage and humility, much failure, and an overwhelming amount of faith in the unknowable.
