-# Community

Beyond our everyday relationships with people, there is the larger community. We first look at some specific types of people we encounter and how best to relate to them.

After that, we start looking at broadening the scope of what we call community, starting with the State and moving through the different forms of life until we hit the universe itself as the full community that we are apart of.
