-# Community

Beyond our everyday relationships with people, there is the larger community. We first look at some specific types of people we encounter and how best to relate to them.

After that, we start looking at broadening the scope of what we call community, starting with the State and moving through the different forms of life until we hit the universe itself as the full community that we are apart of.

The state (government of some form at some level) dominates in modern life. As I write this, the world has been voting in strong men and isolationists in politics. There is a general feeling of winner and loser in these battles. Politics seems to have become a sport and seems to generate a lot of intense emotions. 

But lost in the political debate is the role of the state. At its core is the idea of it being a social contract between individuals to behave and act a certain way. It comes with it the threat of repercussions for those who do not behave in line with that contract. Generally speaking, this works well if most of the population is in agreement with the details of the contract. 

There are states in which this is not true. Violence and threats of violence are the means to that end as well as attempts at brainwashing. Humans are very susceptible to environmental influences in their thinking making this strategy quite possible. But only to a degree at scale. Mostly, fear and hatred are used to control and dominate. 

A good state will focus on trying to bring the society and social contract in line with each other. In the US, there has been numerous directions in which the social contract is changed without the consent of the society. This happens either from court rulings, one party rule, or through law enforcement changes. 

Each one has its challenges. The court rulings are the most difficult to handle. They seem out of the reach of the ordinary individual. Their voices are being suppressed and that, rightfully, angers them. That anger can propagate for years. The mind wishes to be free and express itself, to be heard and to hear. Court rulings cut it off. They often stand against discriminatory practices.
