# Meet Our God

Our universe is our God. We are our God. This is the crux of who God is and one way to find meaning and guidance in living our lives. 

The idea of God being the universe is a matter of faith, but not the same kind of faith that believes the Earth was created 6,000 years ago. This is a faith that is beyond facts, but not in contradiction to facts. This is rather crucial. Our experiences, our believed facts, our view of the world, these are important to embrace, not deny. 

What does science tell us about the world? We want a religion that is in concert with science. There is a grand sweep of what science does tell us about the world, from extremely small distances to vast distances and everything in between. 

While we could talk about science in its vast details, we need only talk about a few relevant ideas. The first, and most important, viewpoint comes from quantum mechanics. This is an area that often has a lot of metaphysical talk because quantum mechanics, as generally presented, is rather mystical. 

Indeed, some of the founders of quantum mechanics were uncomfortable with it and came up with startling consequences of the mysticism. The basic problem is that of measurement because the standard quantum orthodoxy relates the mathematics of wave functions to experiments by explicit axioms of what happens during a measurement; it postulates a collapse of the wave function to definite states, with prescribed probabilities, when a measurement happens. But a measurement is ill-defined. Hence the story of Schr√∂dinger's cat which calls into question whether a cat can be alive and dead simultaneously until a human checks the results. 

This author rejects that mysticism. There are a few completions of quantum mechanics that resolve the cat paradox. The one adopted here is that of Bohmian mechanics. In short, there is the standard wave function of quantum mechanics, a single, universe spanning object, subject to the usual quantum mechanical evolution with no collapse. 

In addition to this, there are the particles. These have positions at all times. Those positions change according to instructions given to it by the wave function. The mental image is that of a bit of wood floating on the ocean, being carried around by the tides of the ocean. These particles are what give our reality definiteness. A cat is either alive or dead, whether anyone looks or not. 

The particles have no influence on the wave function. This is rather unusual in physics. Via the wave function, the position of all the particles influences the motion of each particle. This is practically blasphemy in physics. 

The EPR paradox and Bell's Theorem, both observed in experiments, largely tells us that some kind of instantaneous relation is being maintained. That is to say, there seems to be a now with distance not being a factor in the strength of relations between motions. There are ways around this, but they involve experiments not having definite results when we believe that they do. 

In any event, the idea of Bohmian mechanics is that the wave function guides the particles taking into account the full knowledge of where the particles are. This theory gives rise to all the definite and established statements of orthodox quantum mechanics. It can be argued that this is the minimal completion of orthodox quantum mechanics into a complete theory. 

While it has been firmly established and researched for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the aspects of Bohmian mechanics that complete quantum mechanics work without problem for the relativistic quantum theories, such as quantum field theory. The difficulty in those theories is that the theories used by standard physics are not mathematically well-defined. They can work around this because they just want to get approximate results of experiments instead of a well-defined theory. Bohmian mechanics, on the other hand, needs mathematics that work. Such efforts are underway to resolve many of the mathematical problems using the insights of Bohmian mechanics to resolve problems in physics that have been around for eighty years. 

In short, we have an omniscient, omnipresent object that guides the elements of reality. This is our God. Our God is the wave function. This is the leap from science to religion. It is a matter of faith that this characterization of a mathematical object in a scientific theory is a good way to think about it. It either speaks to you or it does not. 

Okay, great. We know what God is, but what are we? This is where it gets interesting. Our bodies and the stuff we interact with seem to be the particles. The physical being that we are corresponds to particles. This is the reality of what we experience. 

But we have the ability to decide our actions. There is a thought process going on, we feel our own existence. We guide our actions. 

Above, we said that the particles have no back-action on the wave function (God). God does its thing and tells the particles what to do, albeit the instructions are related to the entire configuration of all the particles. Our consciousness is responsible for what we choose to do. 

The author has chosen to type these words. The reader has chosen to read them. We have made choices of our actions. But the only object that does decide the future is the wave function. Hence, our consciousness is a part of the wave function, not the particles. 

We are the mind of God coming to consciousness. Each of us is a part of this great whole.
