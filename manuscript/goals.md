-# Foundations

Here we concern ourselves here with the goals of the religion, the scientific foundation of it, and the fundamental notion of oneness.

# Goals

The goal of this religion is to give a religious experience requiring faith, but not blind faith. This religion is sprucing up the facts as we currently understand it. If the facts change, the religion should change. 

What I want is to create joy and celebration in the world. I want amazement to flourish.
