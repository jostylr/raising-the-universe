# Grief

This is the big one for religions. To live life fully, we will embrace and cherish many of those around us, from our family, to our friends, to our coworkers, to even our beloved enemies. When they die, they leave a deep hole in us. The more we care for them, the more their departure hurts. 

This is often the gateway into religion for the unreligious. This is because grief is incredibly hard and painful to endure. We seek solace anywhere that will offer it. We want to run away from this pain inside of us for fighting it directly seems impossible and what other option does there seem to be? 

Indeed, the pain of grief and loss, whether from death, or the end of a relationship, or simply a monumental mistake on one's part, this pain is a source of near infinite energy to change our lives. This is where the ordinary stops being so and every moment becomes extraordinary, dripping with the power of the new.

How should one deal with grief? That is an age old question for which many others are better qualified to answer. But at the base core of it, it is to let it be. Grief is happening inside of the person, but it is not happening to the person. It is happening to the universe. This is the eternal struggle of life, how to deal with loss, first of others, then of one's own self. The grief strikes deep because it hints at our own loss of ourselves. It reminds us that we are the universe, not an individual. 

It is in that moment of grief, that we have the opportunity to tap into the true being that we are. It opens the door, shredding who we are and putting in its place a rising phoenix of potential. Do not wast this. Do not turn to the easy roads of distractions, of addictions, of other emotions.

Grief will hurt. It should hurt. It will burn deep and you must witness it. Keep your distance, offering no resistance. Find the company of others who will give you a shoulder to cry on. Share the pain, the grief. Let it into the open where many can stand witness with you.

A new life begins as the old ends. Such is the way of our reality.
